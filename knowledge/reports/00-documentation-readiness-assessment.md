## Open Questions Requiring Clarification

### High Priority
1. **Merchant Configuration Lifecycle**: How are merchant configurations created, validated, and updated during operations?
2. **Error Code Standardization**: What are the specific error codes and messages for each failure mode?
3. **API Contract Completion**: Which domain commands should be prioritized for missing RPC implementations?
4. **Role-Based Authorization**: How should admin/user role validation be implemented in the JWT authentication system?

### Medium Priority
5. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are the target response times and throughput requirements?
6. **Background Job Monitoring**: How should per-merchant background job failures be monitored and alerted?
7. **Migration Strategy**: What is the procedure for schema updates across multiple merchant databases?

### Recommendation: **PROCEED WITH DEVELOPMENT**

The Credit Management Service documentation provides an exceptionally strong foundation for implementation. While there are identified gaps and conflicts, they are primarily in operational and integration details rather than core business logic flaws. The documented architecture demonstrates strong engineering discipline and appropriate technology choices.

**The project is ready to begin development following the recommended 4-week preparation timeline.**

**Key Implementation Decisions Deferred Appropriately:**
- **Admin RPC Schemas**: 4 admin command schemas (DebitAdjustment.Apply, Product.Create, Product.Archive, OperationType.CreateWithArchival) can be implemented during development using established patterns
- **Idempotency Complexity**: 4-state vs 2-state idempotency machine decision deferred to implementation phase based on MVP requirements and team complexity assessment
- **Merchant Onboarding Implementation**: Helper functions (generateMerchantJWT, runMigrations, configureMerchantMonitoring) are implementation tasks following documented patterns

### Success Factors
- **Clear Domain Model**: Business requirements are comprehensively specified
- **Proven Architecture**: Multi-tenant, Effect-based design with financial integrity focus
- **Comprehensive Testing**: TDD approach with concrete test patterns
- **Production-Ready Stack**: Mature technologies with documented deployment procedures

### Risk Mitigation
- **Address identified conflicts**: Resolve critical alignment issues before development start
- **Effect framework preparation**: Ensure team proficiency before beginning core implementation  
- **Incremental development**: Follow recommended phased approach starting with core domain logic
- **Continuous testing**: Maintain TDD discipline throughout implementation

The documentation quality exceeds typical project readiness standards and provides a solid foundation for successful implementation by an experienced development team.
