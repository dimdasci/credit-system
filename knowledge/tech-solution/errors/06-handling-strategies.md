# Step 6: Error Handling Strategy Guide

## Purpose
Define error handling strategies for the Credit Management Service focused on maintaining accurate credit ledger operations and providing clear, actionable error context to upstream applications for user communication and recovery decision-making.

## Credit Ledger Service Boundaries

The Credit Management Service has a focused responsibility as a pure accounting ledger:

### Core Service Responsibility
- **Credit Ledger Accuracy**: Maintain precise credit accounting, balance calculation, and audit trail integrity
- **Reliable State Management**: Provide consistent, predictable credit operations with proper transaction guarantees
- **Merchant Data Isolation**: Ensure complete data separation between merchant contexts
- **Audit Compliance**: Preserve immutable operation history for regulatory requirements

### Service Boundary Definition
- **Credit Service Responsibility**: Accurate credit accounting, balance tracking, operation lifecycle state management
- **Upstream Application Responsibility**: User communication, business decision-making, payment processing, UI/UX, workflow orchestration

## Ledger-Focused Error Handling Strategies

### Strategy 1: Revenue-Critical Operations (Priority 1)

**Ledger Context**: Operations that require highest consistency guarantees for financial accuracy and audit integrity.

**Applicable Errors**: ProductUnavailable, InsufficientBalance, OperationUnavailable

#### ProductUnavailable Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Credit operations must reference valid, active products to maintain accounting accuracy.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Product State Verification**: Return current product existence and availability status within merchant context
- **Catalog Reference Validation**: Provide precise product_code validation and merchant_id context
- **State Change Context**: Include reason for unavailability (not_found, archived, geographic_restriction, pricing_changed)
- **Upstream Decision Support**: Supply sufficient context for upstream application to determine alternative actions

**Ledger Rationale**: Product catalog integrity protects credit accounting accuracy. The credit service validates product references and provides factual state information for upstream applications to make business decisions.

#### InsufficientBalance Strategy  
**Ledger Principle**: Balance validation ensures credit consumption operations maintain accounting integrity.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Precise Balance Information**: Return exact current balance for the user within merchant context
- **Available Credit Context**: Reference active credit lots available for consumption
- **Balance Calculation Transparency**: Provide sufficient context for upstream applications to understand current balance state
- **Operation Context**: Include operation_type_code that was blocked due to insufficient balance

**Ledger Rationale**: Insufficient balance represents accurate credit state validation. The credit service provides precise financial state information for upstream applications to guide user actions.

#### OperationUnavailable Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Operation lifecycle state management protects ledger consistency and operation integrity.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Operation State Context**: Return current operation status and lifecycle information for the user
- **Capacity State Information**: Indicate whether unavailability is user-specific or service-wide
- **Current Operation Information**: When user has active operation, provide operation details and lifecycle state
- **State Consistency Preservation**: Maintain operation audit trail during availability restrictions

**Ledger Rationale**: Operation availability reflects credit system state constraints. The credit service provides accurate operation state information for upstream applications to manage user expectations.

### Strategy 2: Administrative Operations (Priority 2)

**Ledger Context**: Administrative operations require precise state tracking and comprehensive audit trail preservation for regulatory compliance.

**Applicable Errors**: DuplicateAdminAction, AuthorizationRequired, InvalidRequest

#### DuplicateAdminAction Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Administrative operation idempotency protects ledger integrity by preventing duplicate state changes.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Original Operation Reference**: Return reference to the successful original administrative action and its ledger impact
- **Audit Trail Preservation**: Log duplicate attempt with original operation context for compliance tracking
- **State Verification Context**: Include sufficient detail for administrators to verify the original action's ledger state
- **No State Modification**: Administrative duplicates never modify ledger state

**Ledger Rationale**: Administrative duplicates represent operational safety mechanism. The credit service preserves ledger integrity by referencing completed administrative actions rather than modifying state.

#### AuthorizationRequired Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Access control boundaries protect merchant ledger data isolation and operation authorization integrity.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Permission Context**: Identify specific authorization required for the attempted ledger operation
- **Merchant Boundary Enforcement**: Ensure authorization validation respects merchant data isolation
- **Operation Context**: Provide operation type and required permission level for authorization systems
- **State Preservation**: Authorization failures never modify ledger state

**Ledger Rationale**: Authorization failures protect ledger data integrity. The credit service provides precise authorization context while maintaining merchant boundary isolation.

#### InvalidRequest Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Request validation protects ledger data integrity by rejecting operations that could corrupt accounting accuracy.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Field Validation Context**: Identify specific request elements that violate ledger integrity constraints
- **Data Format Requirements**: Provide precise expected formats for credit amounts, resource types, and identifiers
- **Integration Feedback**: Supply technical details for upstream application integration debugging
- **Merchant Context Preservation**: Validation failures maintain merchant data isolation

**Ledger Rationale**: Invalid requests represent integration issues that could compromise ledger accuracy. The credit service provides detailed validation context to enable correct integration implementation.

### Strategy 3: Service Reliability Operations

**Ledger Context**: Infrastructure failures require transparent error reporting to protect ledger consistency while enabling upstream application retry strategies.

**Applicable Error**: ServiceUnavailable

#### ServiceUnavailable Strategy
**Ledger Principle**: Infrastructure failures must preserve ledger transaction integrity and provide clear state information for recovery operations.

**Service Response Pattern**:
- **Infrastructure State Context**: Indicate specific infrastructure component failure (database, network, concurrency, external_dependency)
- **Retry Timing Information**: Provide infrastructure-appropriate retry guidance based on failure type
- **Merchant Isolation Preservation**: Ensure infrastructure failures never compromise merchant data boundaries
- **State Consistency Protection**: Maintain transaction integrity during infrastructure issues (complete success or complete rollback)

**Ledger Rationale**: Service unavailability represents temporary infrastructure constraints. The credit service provides accurate infrastructure state information for upstream applications to implement appropriate retry and user communication strategies.

## Cross-Strategy Ledger Principles

### Merchant Data Isolation
**Principle**: Every error handling strategy must preserve absolute merchant ledger data separation.
- Error contexts never expose ledger data from other merchants
- Infrastructure failures in one merchant never impact other merchant ledger operations  
- All error responses operate independently within merchant boundaries

### Audit Trail Integrity  
**Principle**: All error handling must preserve immutable audit trail for regulatory compliance and operational transparency.
- Error responses include sufficient context for audit trail completion
- All error attempts (successful and failed) are logged with full operation context
- Infrastructure failures preserve transaction atomicity (complete success or complete rollback with full context)

### Ledger State Accuracy
**Principle**: Error handling strategies prioritize precise ledger state information and accounting integrity.
- All error responses provide exact current state context (balances, operation status, product availability)
- Financial information is always mathematically accurate and current
- Ledger behavior is predictable and deterministic across identical operation scenarios

### Upstream Integration Support
**Principle**: Error responses provide sufficient context for upstream applications to make informed business decisions and user communications.
- Ledger domain terminology focused on credit accounting concepts
- Actionable state information rather than generic error notifications
- Complete context for upstream applications to implement business logic and user communication

## Operational Pattern Recognition

### High-Frequency Ledger Operations
**Ledger Operations**: Purchase settlements, credit consumption operations, balance calculations
**Error Strategy**: Optimized for consistent state reporting and rapid upstream application decision-making
**Ledger Focus**: Provide precise current state context for upstream applications to guide user interactions

### Low-Frequency Administrative Operations  
**Ledger Operations**: Administrative grants, credit/debit adjustments, product catalog management, refunds
**Error Strategy**: Comprehensive state and audit context for operator verification and compliance
**Ledger Focus**: Enable complete administrative verification with full audit trail preservation

### Infrastructure Operations
**Ledger Operations**: Database transactions, concurrent operation management, state persistence
**Error Strategy**: Clear infrastructure failure classification with retry guidance
**Ledger Focus**: Preserve transaction integrity and provide accurate failure context for upstream retry logic

## Ledger Service Evolution Considerations

### Operational Monitoring
**Ledger Focus**: Track error patterns that indicate ledger integrity and operational efficiency opportunities
- Product validation failures suggesting catalog synchronization improvements  
- Balance calculation patterns indicating credit consumption optimization opportunities
- Administrative error trends suggesting process automation or validation improvements

### Integration Partnership
**Ledger Focus**: Evolve error context to better support upstream application integration and business logic
- Error context consistency for reliable integration development
- State information optimization based on upstream application integration patterns
- Error classification refinement based on actual integration usage patterns

### Compliance Evolution
**Ledger Focus**: Ensure error handling strategies evolve with regulatory and audit requirements
- Audit trail completeness validation for regulatory compliance
- Cross-jurisdictional error handling consistency
- Data protection compliance in error context delivery
