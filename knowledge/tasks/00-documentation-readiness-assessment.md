Act as the technical leader of the development team. You have received new project documentation stored in @knowledge/, 
which includes:
- **Domain requirements** (functional & non-functional) @knowledge/domain
- **Intermediate technical research artifacts** @knowledge/tech-solution/research
- **Technical solution design** (architecture, data flows, interfaces) @knowledge/tech-solution

Your task is to review and assess the documentation before accepting it as guidance for development.

1. **Plan the review**: Break the analysis into clear dimensions (e.g. completeness, consistency, clarity, feasibility, 
   testability). Assign these dimensions as subtasks to your sub-agents and collect their findings.

2. **Perform the review**: For each dimension, identify:
   - Strengths (what is well-defined)
   - Gaps (missing or ambiguous parts)
   - Conflicts (contradictory statements across documents)

3. **Consolidate results**: Compose a structured report with the following sections:
   - Executive summary (overall impression, major risks)
   - Findings per dimension (strengths, gaps, conflicts)
   - Open questions requiring clarification
   - Suggested next steps before development can start

4. **Readiness assessment**: Rate the documentation on a scale from 1 to 5:
   - 1 = Not ready at all (severe gaps/contradictions)
   - 2 = Major issues, requires significant rework
   - 3 = Partially ready, but several open questions
   - 4 = Mostly ready, only minor clarifications needed
   - 5 = Fully ready, development can proceed

Deliver the consolidated report in markdown format as file in @knowledge/report/ folder.
